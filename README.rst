More Highrest
=============

Experiments on a higher level rest directive for Morepath.

Thoughts:

* we need Dectate to allow overriding sub-directives generated by a composite
  directive in the same app, without conflict.

* in an overridden directive, do we need access to the originally generated
  directive somehow?

* the collection management functions should be a whole bunch of functions
  registered for the collection class and the item class. We can introduce
  a specific type of collection base class that has functions registered for it,
  for instance a SQLAlchemy or Pony collection. We can also do this for
  items (dump, load), using the SQLAlchemy and Pony item base classes,
  but instead we could also use the serializer for this and have the serializer
  registered for the collection.
